Leetcode 题解

**第 0000 题：**Power of Two

Given an integer, write a function to determine if it is a power of two.

**第 0001 题：**Number of 1 Bits

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of ’1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

For example, the 32-bit integer ’11' has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011, so the function should return 3.

**第 0002 题：**First Missing Positive 

Given an unsorted integer array, find the first missing positive integer.

For example,
Given [1,2,0] return 3,
and [3,4,-1,1] return 2.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) time and uses constant space.
